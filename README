gitminder is a Qt-based application which helps remind you to commit your local git repositories.

gitminder is currently only tested on Windows, but Linux support is soon to come.

gitminder requirements:
	-Qt5.0
	-libgit2
	
Known issues/future improvements:
	-gitminder leaks memory all over the place (intentionally! I'm still getting a handle on how Qt manages its objects, so this will be fixed with top priority).
	-Contextual system tray icon
	-Sorting destroys previous settings information
	-Performance improvements so all files aren't scanned upon a status change.
	-Recursively add git directories to watchlist
	-Some UI code needs to be separated from the business code (slots aren't being used as effectively as possible)
	-gitminder currently can't check if the remote repo has been updated; this will be implemented eventually, but most of my repos are single-user, so I'm holding off on this one for a bit.

libgit2:
	-To compile libgit, make sure you use the correct debug/release, and DO NOT use stdcall in the cmake configuration.
	-Make sure you use the same compiler as the one Qt is using.
	-Open the VS2010 Command Prompt (not a regular cmd prompt or the Windows SDK one!)
	cd into the libgit2 directory
	mkdir build && cd build
	cmake .. or cmake-gui ..
	cmake --build .
	ctest -V
	cmake --build . --target install
